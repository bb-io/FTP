## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a  file transfer protocol.
To use FTP, you need to have an FTP server, where files can be uploaded, stored, and retrieved in a downloadable format. An FTP server is the type of storage location where files are stored and retrieved.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a FTP server and you have the credentials to access it.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the **FTP** app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'FTP connection'.
4. Fill in the **Host** of your FTP server.
5. Fill in the **Port** of your FTP server (usually it's 21).
6. Fill in the **Username** of user who has access to FTP server.
7. Fill in the **Password** of user who has access to FTP server.
8. Click _Connect_.

## Actions

- **Download file** Download file from server by path.
- **Upload file** Upload files to server by specified path.
- **Delete file** Delete a file from server by specified path.
- **Create directory** Create new directory by specified path.
- **Delete directory** Delete directory from server by specified path.
- **List directory files** List files (name and full path) by specified path
- **Rename file** Rename a file by specified path from old to new

## Events

- **On files created or updated** This polling event triggers when file is created or updated on server.
- **On files deleted** This polling event triggers when file is deleted from server.
- **On directories created** This polling event triggers when directories are created within specified time interval.

## Example 

Here is an example of how you can use the FTP app in a workflow:

<<<<<<< HEAD
![example](images/README/example.png)

=======
>>>>>>> main
In this example, the workflow starts with the **On files created or updated** event, which triggers when any file is added or updated on FTP server. Then, the workflow uses the **Download file** action to download the file that was added/updated. In the next step we translate the file via `DeepL` and then upload the translated file to Slack channel.
